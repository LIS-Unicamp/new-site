# About

The Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS) is part of the the [Institute of Computing](http://www.ic.unicamp.br) (IC) at the [University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br) (UNICAMP).
Here you'll be able to find out more about our Lab, its primary objectives and research interests.

The Lab houses graduate and undergraduate students that work on interdisciplinary research involving, among others, database systems, human-computer interfaces, image processing, computer networks and software engineering.

Its creation, in 1995, was motivated by the need to support data-intensive research within multidisciplinary projects involving computer scientists and scientists from other fields. Throughout the years, it has housed projects in many domains -- in medicine, health, bioinformatics, agriculture, biodiversity, urban planning, telecommunications, and sports -- with scientific results in these fields and in Computer Science, with emphasis in the whole life cycle of data management..

To devise solutions to the data management problems, LIS' research has always needed to  involve researchers from other CS domains needed to design and construct models, techniques and software tools  to help end users store, manage, retrieve, analyze, visualize, share, reuse, publish, preserve and interact with} their data, through "information systems".

Besides being data-driven, research in LIS has always been motivated by applications -- with cooperation with researchers in the life sciences (notably bioinformatics, biodiversity, environmental management, health and medicine), agricultural sciences (and crop planning, monitoring and management) and engineering (notably urban planning).

The first set of domains further helped define the name of the laboratory -- LIS is the Portuguese word for a flower (lily), and thus the laboratory's name has an underlying connotation with living beings and biodiversity issues.
