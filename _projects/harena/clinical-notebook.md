## Clinical Notebook

![Clinical Notebook](/projects/harena/images/clinical-notebook.png)

Health students in practice (interns or residents) or professionals often collect data about their patients, take notes, write diagnostic hypotheses, etc., in some form of paper or digital notebook -- e.g., a word processor. When they develop this task unstructured, data is usually limited to personal consumption. Our Clinical Notebook departs from this concept, expanding it towards a collaborative environment where data is inserted in a semi-structured format, enabling supervision, automated feedback, assistance, and tutoring.
