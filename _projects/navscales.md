title: "NavScales – Navigating through scales in space, time and knowledge domains"
category: projects

excerpt: "Research on climate change necessarily involves integration of data collected at multiple scales on space and time, as well as interaction and cooperation of people from very many disciplines, scientific profiles and backgrounds. The same kind of scenario occurs in many other research initiatives -- e.g., in health (where integrated studies require analysis from molecule to human and back)."

## Overview

Research on climate change necessarily involves integration of data collected at multiple scales on space and time, as well as interaction and cooperation of people from very many disciplines, scientific profiles and backgrounds. The same kind of scenario occurs in many other research initiatives &#8212; e.g., in health (where integrated studies require analysis from molecule to human and back). The goal of this project is to look at these problems from a data point of view, investigating mechanisms that allow presenting such heterogeneous data in a coherent manner, thereby facilitating data sharing and reuse, and scientific collaboration across fields. The algorithms and tools developed within the project will be tested against two real case multiscale scenarios, in agriculture and biodiversity.

## Project Goals

The goal of the NavScales project is to look at multiscale problems from a data point of view, investigating mechanisms that allow managing multiscale data in a coherent manner, thereby facilitating data sharing and reuse, and scientific collaboration across fields. As such, it will design and develop formalisms, algorithms and software tools that will support:
* an integrated view of multiscale data sources, providing scientists with means to navigate across data in multiple scales
* multidisciplinary collaboration, letting domain experts navigate across scientific literature in multiple domains
